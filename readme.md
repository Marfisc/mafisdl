## About

This is a wrapper around the [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) for the D programming language. For the dynamic binding it uses [DerelictSDL2](https://github.com/DerelictOrg/DerelictSDL2). It enables a API more adapted to D while staying close to the way the SDL works.
This library was created to ease the creation of specific personal projects.

## Build

This repository contains a working `dub.json`. Download the repository and use dub's add-local command. Then add this library as dependency.

## License
